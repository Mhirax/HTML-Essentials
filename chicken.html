<h1>chickens</h1>

The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated 
subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus), originally
native to Southeast Asia. It was first domesticated around
8,000 years ago and is one of the most common and widespread
domesticated animals in the world. Chickens are primarily 
kept for their meat and eggs, though they are also kept
 as pets.

<p>
As of 2023, the global chicken population exceeds 26.5 billion, 
with more than 50 billion birds produced annually for consumption. 
Specialized breeds such as broilers and laying hens have been developed
for meat and egg production, respectively.
